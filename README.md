## Execution

### *How to use*

Simply `Run All Cells` to execute the code in every cell of the notebook in sequence. Alternatively, each cell may be `Run` on its own, though it is still recommended to run them in order.

### *Breaking down the cells*

Below is a more in-depth explanation of the various cells coded within the `retrieve_movie_data.ipynb` notbook.
